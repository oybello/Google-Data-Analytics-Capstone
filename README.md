Currently, cyclist has 2 kinds of customers: 
casual riders & annual members.
Casual riders purchase single-ride or full-day passes
While annual members purchase annual membership &
also dominate  patronage

Consequently, the company wants to convert
Casual members to annual members to
increase annual patronage & 
maximize yearly profit-margin significantly
The primary objective of this study is therefore to:
Gain insight into how  casual and annual members differ
Understand why casual members will buy a membership 
Recommend the marketing campaign that will:
increase Cyclistâ€™s revenue significantly and 
expand customer-base significantly
