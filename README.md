Study on How to Maximize the Profit Margin and Widen the Customer-base of a Motor-bike Company - Cyclistics
Currently, cyclist has 2 kinds of customers: casual riders & annual members.
Casual riders purchase single-ride or full-day passes, while annual members purchase annual membership and also dominate patronage.

Consequently, the company wants to convert casual members to annual members in order to increase annual patronage and maximize yearly profit-margin significantly.

The primary objective of this study is therefore to:
gain insight into how  casual and annual members differ
understand why casual members will buy a membership 
recommend the marketing campaign that will increase Cyclistâ€™s revenue and expand customer-base significantly
